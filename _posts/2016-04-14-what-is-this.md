What is this?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8b859256-46ed-4bcc-bb50-4f1c2637bc8e.jpg)

So I wanna build some bots. I wanna do it with Java because I like my codez strongly typed and I want to build big bots and the JVM rocks.

So... come and help me build some open source tooling for Javaland to enable BotBuilding. Bots are the new apps don't ya know?! ;-)
